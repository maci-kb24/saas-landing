# GroundDesk

Landing page for a SAAS startup built with Tailwind.

Live site - (https://saas-landing-page-tailwind.netlify.app/)


## Challenge

The challenge was to build the project with Tailwind which i used for the first time so i learned a lot, it is easier to customize than Bootstrap and i can see Tailwind being used in prototyping, small or large projects it makes sense.
