Landing page for a SAAS startup built with Tailwind.

## Challenge

The challenge was to building the project with Tailwind which i use for the first time so i learn a lot, it is easier to customize than Bootstrap and i can see it Tailwind beind used in prototyping, small or large projects it's makes sense.
